# Todo List form module 14.3 of MITxPro Fullstack in MERN bootcamp!!

# Description
    This small ToDo list was built using React, styles in plain css.
    To add new ToDo's just type in the input and press enter.
    To erase a ToDo click on it and it will be gone forever!!

    This ToDo list is an exercise to practice basic concepts of CRUD using react, it cannot store data in the long-term.

# How to make it work
    Download all files in the todo-list branch (master branch only contains the MIT licence).
    Be sure to have a server (http-server or npm run dev would work fine).
    Run the server and open index.html, be sure to always have the form.jx, index.js, todo.js and style.css in the same
    folder as index.html OR modify the routes to this files in the index.html script src's route.

# Future work
    It would actually be nice to evolve this exorcise in a private ToDo list that can hold to tasks or a full agenda.
